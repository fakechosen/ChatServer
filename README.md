# Chat Server Console Project

The Chat Server Console Project is a robust server console application developed in C/C++ that facilitates seamless communication between multiple clients. The project leverages the TCP transport protocol to ensure guaranteed and in-order delivery of chat messages, crucial for maintaining the integrity of communication in a chat environment.

## Project Objectives
- **Utilizing TCP Transport Protocol:** The project primarily focuses on utilizing the TCP transport protocol to ensure guaranteed and in-order data delivery. This choice is particularly relevant for chat functionality, where dropped messages or out-of-order delivery is undesirable.
- **Socket Programming Expertise:** Through developing this server console application, emphasis is placed on gaining expertise in C/C++ through socket programming. This involves implementing various socket functionalities to establish and manage communication channels between the server and clients.
- **Multithreading and In-thread Multiplexing:** The project integrates multithreading and in-thread multiplexing techniques for efficient service handling. This allows the server to handle multiple client connections simultaneously, ensuring smooth communication without blocking.
- **Compatibility Testing:** The chosen client for testing, Spaghetti Relay, follows the same logic for message exchange, ensuring compatibility with the developed server. This compatibility testing ensures that the server can seamlessly communicate with different clients adhering to the same protocol.

## Learning Goals
- **Reviving C/C++ Programming Knowledge:** By undertaking this project, I aimed to revive and apply my C/C++ programming knowledge, particularly in the context of networking and socket programming.
- **Enhancing Project and Time Management Skills:** Developing a functional and performant chat server requires effective project and time management skills. Through this project, I had the opportunity to hone these skills while working towards achieving the specified objectives.

## Conclusion
The Chat Server Console Project provides an opportunity to apply one's C/C++ programming skills in a practical context, while also gaining valuable insights into networking protocols and communication mechanisms. The ultimate goal was to create a functional and efficient chat server that meets the specified objectives, contributing to the broader understanding of networked applications.
